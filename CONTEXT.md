# Custom Cabinet Context

## Product

Custom Cabinet is an independently maintained frontend for a compatible
Upstream Bot. It works as a normal web application and as a Telegram Mini App.

The product has three interface modes:

1. Public authentication and transactional flows.
2. User Cabinet for subscriptions, connection, payments and account management.
3. Administrative console protected by roles and permissions.

## Current Release Reference

As of `2026-08-28`, `main` contains the released Upstream Cabinet `v1.66.0`
integration through `92906d0e9a128d0a6cdf0f056996e4db44d72d94`.

- Latest published candidate: Custom Cabinet `cabinet-v2026.08.28.1`, commit
  `2a49b1350ab98e177c0d62d26462381aeca97648`, through Release Bundle
  `v2026.08.28`. Public assets and a fresh disposable-VPS smoke passed; this
  candidate has not been deployed to production.
- Production management Installer: `v2026.08.25`, commit
  `27e73f662297bbfe459af86cbe00b2a132d8ac0e`.
- Running production Release Bundle: `v2026.08.24`, policy
  `rollback-compatible`.
- Production Custom Cabinet: `cabinet-v2026.08.24.4`, commit
  `3250e3a7f31fc2dc6f2c7779a42d86cf99a03210`.
- Production baseline, transition, Status, Diagnostics, health, exact runtime
  identities and authorized browser smoke passed. The later Installer update
  was management-only and did not change the runtime Bundle.
- Real Telegram Android/iOS, physical screen-reader, authenticated staging,
  initial Remnawave synchronization and Remnawave `3.3.0+` GeoCheck remain
  `BLOCKED`, not `PASS`.

See [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md) for exact source, image and Release
Bundle identities. Historical live-check reports retain the result known at
their verification date and must not be reinterpreted as current production
state.

## Actors

**Guest**

An unauthenticated visitor using Login, registration, legal, callback or public
purchase flows.

**User**

An authenticated customer who needs to understand subscription state, connect a
device, pay, renew and get support with minimal cognitive load.

**Administrator**

An authenticated operator with one or more administrative permissions.

**Installer**

The supported installation and update path for a committed Custom Cabinet and a
compatible Release Bundle.

**Upstream Cabinet**

The external source Cabinet from which selected changes are intentionally
integrated.

**Upstream Bot**

The compatible external Bot providing Cabinet APIs and Telegram behavior.

**Release Bundle**

An immutable, verified combination of Installer, Upstream Bot, Custom Cabinet
and runtime images.

## Primary User Jobs

- Understand whether the service is active.
- Connect the current device.
- Buy or renew a subscription.
- Check traffic and device usage.
- Top up balance and understand payment result.
- Manage account identity and notifications.
- Reach support when a critical flow fails.

## Product Direction

The user Cabinet prioritizes clarity over feature visibility. Critical status
and primary actions stay visible. Secondary settings and multi-step operations
use progressive disclosure through accessible dialogs or sheets.

The interface must remain compatible with Upstream Cabinet behavior, Upstream
Bot contracts, Telegram navigation and Installer-based deployment.

## Canonical Rules

- Do not use public upstream branding as Custom Cabinet branding.
- Preserve exact technical attribution, source URLs, Git SHAs and licenses.
- Keep presentation separate from authentication, payment, subscription and
  platform behavior.
- Preserve callback routes and deep links when simplifying visible navigation.
- Test user-facing changes through whole browser scenarios and the live-check
  process after installation through Installer.
