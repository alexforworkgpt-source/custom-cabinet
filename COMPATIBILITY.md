# Compatibility Matrix

This document records verified source compatibility for each Custom Cabinet
baseline and Release Bundle. Tags and commit SHAs are immutable technical
identifiers, not public branding.

## Current Source Baseline

| Component | Version or reference | Exact source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Cabinet | `1.65.0` | Repository commit to be pinned by the Release Bundle |
| Upstream Cabinet baseline | `v1.65.0` | `b866bebeeb6032db4baa3869a4917316fe8e0453` |
| Upstream Cabinet source | Repository | <https://github.com/BEDOLAGA-DEV/bedolaga-cabinet.git> |
| Upstream Bot | Not recorded in this repository yet | Must be supplied and verified before the next compatible Release Bundle |
| Node.js development baseline | 20+ | Declared in `README.md` |

The current upstream source identity is also recorded in
[`UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md). If this table and `UPSTREAM.md` disagree, stop and
resolve the provenance mismatch before synchronization or release.

## Release Bundle Record

No verified Release Bundle compatibility row is recorded here yet. Add one only
after the complete applicable gate has passed.

Use this format for every released combination:

| Release Bundle | Installer commit | Upstream Bot tag/SHA | Custom Cabinet tag/commit | Upstream Cabinet baseline SHA | Runtime images | Verification date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vYYYY.MM.N` | exact SHA | exact tag and SHA | immutable tag and SHA | exact SHA | immutable digests | YYYY-MM-DD | known constraints |

## Update Rules

Do not infer compatibility from matching version numbers. Verify the API and
runtime behavior against the exact Upstream Bot source selected for the Release
Bundle.

When Upstream Cabinet changes an API contract, WebSocket event, permission,
payment flow, deep link or Telegram behavior, record the minimum compatible
Upstream Bot source.

Do not update this matrix at the start of an integration. Update it only after
the selected Custom Cabinet commit and Upstream Bot source pass the applicable
tests and browser/platform smoke checks.

Do not replace an existing Release Bundle row or asset. Publish a changed
combination under a new immutable tag.
